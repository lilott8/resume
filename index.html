                    <ul>
                        <li>Designed a service comprised of 4 micro-services allowing customers to send data between realms; led a team of 7 to build said service.</li>
                        <li>Reduced operational overhead (e.g., sev2s) by 22% by improving process and code quality.</li>
                        <li>Created processes and guidelines to help teams develop, communicate, and share efficiently.</li>
                        <li>Ameliorated a code base which resulted in an 80% reduction in build and compilation times.</li>
                        <li>Developed several novel solutions to optimize query response on temporal data that reduced response time by as much as 64%.</li>
                        <li>Technical lead and mentor for several teams, comprised of 13 engineers, helping them develop technical skills and grow in their capabilities as technical contributors.</li>
                        <li>Leading the design, architecture, and team of 4 engineers in delivery of a distributed temporal graph database to track internal and customer assets in near real-time, as they evolve over time. This has already saved OCI’s Detection and Response Team hundred of employee-hours. It will further save customer’s and service teams countless hours of working to understand how changes affect their service(s).

                    <ul>
                        <li>Designed and implemented BioScript, a domain specific language and its corresponding Python-based SSA/SSI-based compiler, which enables biologists and chemist to express experiments for automated design and execution of a scientific experiment; saving hundreds of hours normally spent in design and fabrication. BioScript is currently being used in commercial and collaborative research endeavors.</li>
                        <li>Developed ChemType and ChemStor, tools capable of ensuring safe laboratory working conditions by guaranteeing chemicals that may result in adverse reactions do not get mixed during experimentation and that they are not stored or disposed of in containers where adverse reactions may occur. These tools have demonstrated their ability to prevent prior laboratory incidents and have prevented several incidents in a collaborator's laboratory.</li>
                        <li>Built Kratos, a Java-based multi-threaded static analysis tool, enables the automatic discovery of alternate execution paths to sensitive operations that require user permission to access. Google has expressed interest in using this tool.</li>
                        <li>Created HLB indexer, a distributed Java-based Twitter data filter capable of tracking the spread of HLB, a nefarious citrus-based disease. The HLB indexer is able to accurately identify new cases of HLB infection, potentially saving hundreds of thousands of dollars and countless citrus trees.</li>
                        <li>Managed a team of 15 computer science undergraduate researchers teaching them best practices for writing production-quality code, including code reviews, writing test cases, and brainstorming interesting directions to further research endeavors.</li>
