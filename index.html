                    <ul>
                        <li>Designed and implemented BioScript, a domain specific language and its corresponding Python-based SSA/SSI-based compiler, which enables biologists and chemist to express experiments for automated design and execution of a scientific experiment; saving hundreds of hours normally spent in design and fabrication. BioScript is currently being used in commercial and collaborative research endeavors.</li>
                        <li>Developed ChemType and ChemStor, tools capable of ensuring safe laboratory working conditions by guaranteeing chemicals that may result in adverse reactions do not get mixed during experimentation and that they are not stored or disposed of in containers where adverse reactions may occur. These tools have demonstrated their ability to prevent prior laboratory incidents and have prevented several incidents in a collaborator's laboratory.</li>
                        <li>Built Kratos, a Java-based multi-threaded static analysis tool, enables the automatic discovery of alternate execution paths to sensitive operations that require user permission to access. Google has expressed interest in using this tool.</li>
                        <li>Created HLB indexer, a distributed Java-based Twitter data filter capable of tracking the spread of HLB, a nefarious citrus-based disease. The HLB indexer is able to accurately identify new cases of HLB infection, potentially saving hundreds of thousands of dollars and countless citrus trees.</li>
                        <li>Managed a team of 15 computer science undergraduate researchers teaching them best practices for writing production-quality code, including code reviews, writing test cases, and brainstorming interesting directions to further research endeavors.</li>
