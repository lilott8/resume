                        <li>Developed several novel solutions to optimize query response on temporal data that reduced response time by as much as 64%.</li>
                        <li>Technical lead and mentor for 2 teams, comprised of 13 engineers, helping them develop technical skills and grow in their capabilities as technical contributors.</li>
